# LED-Cube

Credit to https://www.instructables.com/member/HippyNerd/ for some instructions on understanding the LED cube  
Credit to Asher Glick https://aglick.com/charliecube.html for the creation of charlieplexing an LED cube

These are my files for my charliecube clock (Charlieplexed LED's + 7 segment display + RTC module)   
Clock RTC and segment display are accessed using i2c to minimize pins used on the arduino  
No shift registers are needed for this design. only the pins available on a basic arduino or arduino nano

If you would like any help on your design, feel free to reach out.
